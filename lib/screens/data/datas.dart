      "Desc":"Mohammed Shami's return to the Indian T20 International side is set to be further delayed. Cricbuzz learns that the pacer has not fully recovered from the Covid infection that kept him out of the just-concluded series against Australia. Shami could then also miss the three T20I series against South Africa starting Wednesday (September 28). And so could Deepak Hooda, who is currently down with a back injury and wasn't available for the Sunday's decider in Hyderabad.",
      "Desc2":"For the record, Shami has not travelled to Thiruvananthapuram, the venue for the first game where the Indian team reached on Monday evening. Umesh Yadav, who was announced as a replacement for Shami, has travelled with the team, an indication that he will be part of the three-match South Africa series too. The South African team is already in the Kerala city since Sunday.",
      "Desc3":"It's understood that there is still no decision on whether Shami will be able to travel with the Indian side to Australia for the World Cup. 'There is no medical update about the time that will take for him to be fully fit but currently it does not look good,' a source in the know said. Shami is among four standbys for the World Cup. Shami has not played a T20I after the last World Cup in UAE. His last international was in July, an away ODI against England.",
